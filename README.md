## About The Project
This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.
The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools & Tech-stack you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

<br>


## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
